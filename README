This program is written in Assembly for PIC Microcontroller. It implemented the ADC to simulate the job of Volmeter in reality with the suport of LCD screen.
We'd also provided the Proteus simulation file for the testing purpose.
It's recommended to open this project in MPLAB http://www.microchip.com/
